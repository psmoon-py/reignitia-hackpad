# ReIgnitia

**Power Your Potential**

> No Student Left Behind. No Talent Wasted.

ReIgnitia is a global, free, student-first mission control platform. Built for [Student Hackpad 2025](https://studenthackpad.devpost.com/), it helps students navigate learning roadmaps, scholarships, mental health, focus management, STEM opportunities, and curated communities.

## What is ReIgnitia?

ReIgnitia (ree-ig-NISH-uh) provides integrated tools for students through a single, beautiful mission control interface.

### Core Philosophy

- **100% Free**: No paywalls, subscriptions, or hidden costs

- **Client-Side Only**: All processing happens in your browser
- **Globally Accessible**: Works offline-first with cached data
- **Student-First**: Built by students, for students

## The Six Labs

### 1. Learn Orbits
Interactive learning roadmaps for STEM fields using free resources. Visualize your path from beginner to expert with curated steps from Khan Academy, MIT OCW, freeCodeCamp, and more.

### 2. Money Lab
Scholarship discovery engine and cost-of-study calculator. Find real opportunities from INSPIRE, Google scholarships, DAAD, and Breakthrough Junior Challenge. Plan your education budget with realistic estimates.

### 3. Wellbeing Observatory
Micro mental health tools for stressed students. Quick breathing exercises, grounding techniques, and mood-based support.

### 4. Time Focus Station
Study session structuring with research-backed focus presets. Pomodoro, exam sprints, gentle starts—all tracked locally to build productivity patterns.

### 5. Opportunity Radar
Discover STEM competitions, hackathons, and fairs like NASA Space Apps, Regeneron ISEF, Breakthrough Junior Challenge, and regional opportunities.

### 6. Peer Dock
Curated directory of existing free learning communities. Connect with OSSU CS, freeCodeCamp forums, Art of Problem Solving, Physics Stack Exchange, and more.

## Built for Student Hackpad 2025

ReIgnitia was created for [Student Hackpad 2025](https://studenthackpad.devpost.com/). The goal is to make student life better through innovation, impact, and design.

**Impact**: Addresses barriers facing students globally—learning poverty, funding gaps, mental health crises, and opportunity deserts.

**Innovation**: Mission control interface that integrates disconnected resources into a cohesive, usable system.

**Design**: Cinematic storytelling, glassmorphism UI, scroll-driven animations, and accessible interactions.
